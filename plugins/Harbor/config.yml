# Important note regarding Essentials:
# Please make sure you negate the permission "essentials.sleepingignored" to
# prevent issues with Harbor and server operators when running Essentials.

  daytime-ticks: 1200 # The time in ticks that Harbor considers day
  instant-skip: false # Instantly skip the night when the percentage threshold is reached instead of showing the full animation
  proportional-acceleration: false # Increase the night skipping speed based on the amount of sleeping players
  clear-rain: true # Clear rain (if it's raining) when the night is skipped
  clear-thunder: true # Clear thunder (if it's thundering) when the night is skipped
  reset-phantom-statistic: false # Treats everyone online as if they have slept in the last 3 days after the night is skipped (check out /gamerule doInsomnia on 1.15+)
